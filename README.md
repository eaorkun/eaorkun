# Hi, I'm Eralp.

I'm studying Electrical and Computer Engineering @ UT Austin and an incoming Research and Development Intern at Trend Micro for this upcoming summer. I'm also currently seeking a software engineering Co-op/Intern position for Fall 2021. I enjoy creating great software and am proficient at low-level through high-level programming languages with general knowledge in computer architecture and memory management. Some of my hobbies include music and rock climbing.
